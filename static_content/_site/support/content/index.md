Support of DOAJ by academic organisations is vital and we are proud to acknowledge that over 80% of our support comes to us this way. We are very grateful to all our supporting academic organisations from around the world.

The suggested contributions for academic organisations are detailed below: choose the most appropriate option for your organisation. 

For our larger publishing supporters, we have a series of suggested [contributor categories plus benefits](/support/sponsors/). For the smaller publishing organisations, our [publisher contributions](/support/publisher-supporters/) may be more suitable.

For those of you wishing to make a one-off donation, you can do that on this page too.
